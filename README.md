## Challenge
Create a data visualization based on information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

## Background
Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through the latest information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

## Results
I utilized D3.js to visualize all data provided so a reader may explore relationships to any of the factors presented: Poverty Rate/Median Age/Median Income vs Healthcare Access/Smoking/Obesity.

Additionally, I incorporated tool tips to summarize each data points using `d3-tip.js` plugin developed by [Justin Palmer](https://github.com/Caged).
